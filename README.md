# ROS Robots Movements According to Obstacles
  Motion-plan: Two robots start moving up until they detect the wall with their sensors; then they turn left/right, and then move down/up until they detect the wall again with their sensors. This motion pattern is executed by each robot three times (i.e. for three rounds). After three rounds, the robots should stop facing down. The robots should always face the directions that they move. The y-axis of the robotsâ€™ starting locations is 1.
